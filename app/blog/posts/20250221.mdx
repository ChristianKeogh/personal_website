Many have been touting the education revolution that has supposedly arrived whereby you can use AI to learn new concepts faster and better than traditional education methods. Elon Musk said that "One of the most important uses of AI is helping people learn faster and more effectively." I think this is completely true already for cases like coding. Ask it to help you learn Haskell or how to create a Node server and it has no problem. It will walk you through each step and explain everything in detail if you like. Learning Software Development has truly been revolutionised by AI.

But where it falls down significantly compared to quick and free resources like Wikipedia is pictures and diagrams. If I want to learn how a Transistor works, why would I ask an LLM? I would have a far easier time just googling it and getting actual and factual easy to digest information. LLMs by contrast are often walls of text with a few hallucinations thrown in. Below is some examples of me trying regardless:

Grok fails, ChatGPT gives a generated image, Gemini actually supplies real diagrams, but it’s still crap. By contrast Wikipedia (yes it’s biased, but in hard science is great for overviews) has an explanation with beautiful diagrams, photos and tables to clearly explain how a transistor works, what they look like, and their history. How can LLMs possibly compete with this? Not only that, people on the right have complained of Wikipedia's left leaning tendencies and sometimes outright lies but at least they try to fix errors and supply sources. AI will have a left bias, lie, and it will be harder to spot or rectify it so it doesn’t happen again.

But while AI firms have been working hard on hallucinations since the beginning, there seems to be no movement on increasing the amount of visual aids. It shouldn’t be that hard because I know from experience that they are perfectly capable of finding images and understanding them. I have asked ChatGPT to help me with problems before and when it responds so intelligently to the photo I attach I always react with amazement.

Instead lately most AI firms have doubled down on pure text responses with tools like Reasoning and DeepResearch/DeepSearch. Even with all that extra computing power being used I still prefer learning about anything not related to coding from established resources.

Only this week CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella and Elon have both announced opening games studios entirely powered by AI. If this is possible, maybe learn to walk before you can run. Have ChatBots become a true teaching assistant that can compete with older ways. It is possible, it shouldn’t be that hard, and reap all the benefits. For now Wikipedia will stay the favourite for people who want to learn something quickly and efficiently.
